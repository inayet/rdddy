    """
    The Address class is a value object that represents a physical address in a reactive DDD system. It is responsible for encapsulating the data related to an address, such as street name, city, state, and zip code. This class is immutable, meaning its values cannot be changed once it is created. It is used to ensure that the system maintains consistency and accuracy when dealing with addresses. The Address class also plays a crucial role in domain logic, as it is often used as a parameter in methods and functions to perform operations related to addresses. Additionally, it is used for validation purposes, ensuring that only valid addresses are accepted by the system. Overall, the Address class is an essential component of a reactive DDD system, providing a reliable and standardized way to handle address data.
