    """
    The Quantity class represents a value object in a reactive domain-driven design (DDD) system. It is responsible for encapsulating a specific quantity or amount, such as a number of items or a measurement. This class is immutable and is used to ensure that the quantity remains consistent throughout the system. It is used in conjunction with other classes to perform calculations and make decisions based on the quantity value. The Quantity class is an essential component in a reactive DDD system as it helps maintain data integrity and supports the reactive principles of event-driven and message-driven architectures.
