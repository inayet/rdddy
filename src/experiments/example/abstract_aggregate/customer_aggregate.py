    The CustomerAggregate class is responsible for managing the state and behavior of a customer entity in the reactive DDD system. It acts as a container for all related domain objects and business logic, ensuring consistency and integrity of the customer data. This class also serves as the entry point for all external requests and events related to the customer entity, and coordinates the communication between different domain objects within the aggregate. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the reactive nature of the system by reacting to changes in the customer state and triggering appropriate actions.
