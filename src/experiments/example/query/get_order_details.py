    """
    The GetOrderDetails class is responsible for retrieving and providing detailed information about an order in a reactive DDD system. It acts as a query handler, receiving requests for order details and returning the relevant data. This class plays a crucial role in the system, as it allows other components to access and use order information without directly interacting with the underlying data store. By encapsulating the logic for retrieving order details, this class promotes a more modular and maintainable architecture.
