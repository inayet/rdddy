"""Module: Enhanced Actor System for Page Generation
=================================================

Overview
--------
This module implements an Enhanced Actor System designed to manage the lifecycle of web page generation processes within a software development project. Utilizing the Enhanced Chatman Calculus Notation (ECCN), the system formalizes the interactions between different actors (e.g., ProjectManager, FullStackDeveloper) to ensure reliable execution of commands, such as generating new pages, and handling potential errors. ECCN provides a rigorous framework for defining actor behaviors, command handling, and event responses, enhancing system predictability and maintainability.

ECCN Specification
------------------

### Actors

- **ProjectManager (PM)**: Initiates the project setup and issues commands for page generation.
- **FullStackDeveloper (FSD)**: Responds to page generation commands by executing the necessary actions and publishing the outcome as events.

### Commands and Events

- **GeneratePageCommand**: Issued by PM to request the generation of a new page.
- **PageGeneratedEvent**: Published by FSD upon successful page generation.
- **GenerationErrorEvent**: Published by FSD in case of errors during page generation.

### ECCN Formalization

#### Actor Initialization

\\[ AS.init() \rightarrow PM \\oplus FSD \\]

#### Command Generation and Event Handling

- **Command Generation (CG)**:

  \\[ CG(PM, "Homepage", "/") \rightarrow cmd_{GeneratePage} \\]

- **Page Generation (PG)**:

  \\[ PG(FSD, cmd_{GeneratePage}) \\Rightarrow \\left\\{ \begin{array}{ll} Pre: & cmd_{GeneratePage}.name = "Homepage" \\ Action: & generate\\_page(cmd_{GeneratePage}) \\ Post: & PageGeneratedEvent(name = "Homepage") \\end{array} \right. \\]

- **Error Handling (EH)**:

  \\[ EH(FSD, cmd_{GeneratePage}) \\Rightarrow \\left\\{ \begin{array}{ll} Pre: & cmd_{GeneratePage}.name = "Homepage" \\ Action: & generate\\_page(cmd_{GeneratePage}) \rightarrow \text{Exception} \\ Post: & GenerationErrorEvent(error\\_message) \\end{array} \right. \\]

#### Invariant Maintenance

\\[ SI(FSD, cmd_{GeneratePage}) \\Leftrightarrow (PageGeneratedEvent \vee GenerationErrorEvent) \\]
