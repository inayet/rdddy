    The OrderAggregate class is responsible for managing the state and behavior of an order within the reactive DDD system. It acts as a container for all the entities and value objects related to an order, and coordinates their interactions to ensure consistency and integrity of the order. This class is responsible for handling all business logic related to orders, such as creating, updating, and canceling orders, as well as handling any events or commands related to orders. It also serves as the entry point for external systems to interact with orders in the reactive DDD system. Overall, the OrderAggregate class plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall consistency and integrity of orders within the reactive DDD system.
