    The CheckoutFormSubmitted class represents a user interface event that is triggered when a user submits a checkout form in a reactive DDD system. This event is responsible for updating the state of the system and triggering any necessary actions, such as processing the payment and updating the order status. It contains information about the submitted form, such as the user's input and selected items, and can be subscribed to by other classes to react to the event. This class plays a crucial role in the reactive DDD system, as it allows for seamless communication between the user interface and the backend logic.
