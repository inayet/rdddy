    The Price class is a value object that represents the monetary value of a product or service in a reactive domain-driven design (DDD) system. It is used to encapsulate and manage the price data for various entities within the system, such as products, services, and orders. This class is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed once it is created, ensuring consistency and preventing unintended modifications. It also contains methods for performing calculations and comparisons with other Price objects, making it a reliable and essential component in the reactive DDD system.
