    The CustomerOrderHistoryReadModel class is responsible for storing and retrieving data related to customer order history in a reactive DDD system. It serves as a read-only representation of the customer order history, providing a way for other components to access and query this data. This class is an essential part of the reactive DDD system, as it allows for efficient and consistent access to customer order history data, enabling other components to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. It also helps to maintain the separation of concerns between the read and write sides of the system, ensuring that the read side remains scalable and responsive.
