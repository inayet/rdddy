    """
    The CalculateShippingCosts class is a crucial component of a reactive DDD system that handles the calculation of shipping costs. It takes in relevant information such as weight, distance, and shipping method and uses this data to determine the appropriate shipping costs for a given order. This class utilizes reactive principles to ensure that any changes to the order or shipping information are immediately reflected in the calculated shipping costs. It also follows domain-driven design principles to ensure that the logic for calculating shipping costs is encapsulated within this class, making it easy to maintain and modify in the future.
