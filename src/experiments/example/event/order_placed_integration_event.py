    """
    The OrderPlacedIntegrationEvent class is responsible for representing an event that is triggered when a new order is placed in the system. This class serves as a bridge between the reactive DDD system and external systems, allowing for seamless communication and integration. It contains all the necessary information about the order, such as customer details, order items, and payment information. This class plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and ensuring that all systems are updated with the latest order information. It also serves as a trigger for other processes and actions within the reactive DDD system, allowing for a reactive and event-driven approach to handling orders.
